description: A story about Cygwin local privilege escalation using privileged inherited handles of zombie processes

## Vulnerability ##

Two months ago, I was playing with Cygwin and I noticed that all Cygwin processes inherited dead process handles using [Process Hacker](https://wj32.org/processhacker/nightly.php):

![Process Hacker showing dead handles]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/assets/media/CygwinProcessHacker.png "Process Hacker showing dead handles")

*Bash.exe* process spawned by SSH daemon after a successful connection **(1)** runs with a newly created token as limited test user.

Indeed, Cygwin SSHD worked at the time with an administrator account (*cyg_server*) emulating set(e)uid by creating a new user token using undocumented *NtCreateToken*.
See [Cygwin documentation](https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html) for more information about the change with version 3.0.

The same *bash.exe* process inherits 3 handles of non-existent processes with full access rights **(2)**.

Tracing the process creation and termination with [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) during the SSH connection revealed that these leaked handles are actually privileged process **(3)** running as *cyg_server*.


## Exploitation ##

So what can we do with privileged zombie process handles, since we have full access (_PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS_) we can:

Access Right | Possible action
---- | ---
_OpenProcessToken_ | **FAIL** Access denied
_PROCESS_VM_OPERATION_ | **FAIL**: Any VM operation will fail because the process does not have a address space anymore
_PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD_ | **FAIL**: Same problem, no address space, creating thread in the process will NOT work
_PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE_ | **FAIL**: Access denied on DuplicateHandle (not sure why :D)
_PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS_ | **SUCCESS**: Finally! Let's see how to use this privilege:


&nbsp;

When creating a process, the attribute *PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS* in *STARTUPINFO* structure allows the calling process to use a different process as the parent for the process being created.
The calling process must have **PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS** access right on the process handle used as the parent.

From Windows documentation: *Attributes inherited from the specified process include handles, the device map, processor affinity, priority, quotas, the process token, and job object.* **So the spawned process will use the privileged token thus it will run as cyg_server**:

![CMD running as cyg_server after exploit]({{ site.BASE_PATH }}/assets/media/CygwinExploit.png "CMD running as cyg_server after exploit")

&nbsp;

This exploitation technique is not new and there are maybe other ways to exploit this case but I wanted to show a real world example of create process with parent handle instead of just posting about it. I find it cleaner than injecting a shellcode in a privileged process to spawn a process.

## Fix ##

The vulnerability is now fixed with Cygwin version 3.0 thanks to the maintainers that were very responsive.
